  abstract = {A wealth of palaeoecological studies (e.g. pollen, diatoms, chironomids and macrofossils from deposits such as lakes or bogs) have revealed major as well as more subtle ecosystem changes over decadal to multimillennial timescales. Such ecosystem changes are usually assumed to have been forced by specific environmental changes. Here, we test if the observed changes in palaeoecological records may be reproduced by random simulations, and we find that simple procedures generate abrupt events, long-term trends, quasi-cyclic behaviour, extinctions and immigrations. Our results highlight the importance of replicated and multiproxy data for reliable reconstructions of past climate and environmental changes.},

  abstract = {A proxy system model may be defined as the complete set of forward and mechanistic processes by which the response of a sensor to environmental forcing is recorded and subsequently observed in a material archive. Proxy system modeling complements and sharpens signal interpretations based solely on statistical analyses and transformations; provides the basis for observing network optimization, hypothesis testing, and data-model comparisons for uncertainty estimation; and may be incorporated as weak but mechanistically-plausible constraints into paleoclimatic reconstruction algorithms. Following a review illustrating these applications, we recommend future research pathways, including development of intermediate proxy system models for important sensors, archives, and observations; linking proxy system models to climate system models; hypothesis development and evaluation; more realistic multi-archive, multi-observation network design; examination of proxy system behavior under extreme conditions; and generalized modeling of the total uncertainty in paleoclimate reconstructions derived from paleo-observations.},

  abstract = {Because anthropogenic impacts on ecological systems pre-date the oldest scientific observations, historical documents and archaeological records, understanding modern extinctions requires additional data sources that extend further back in time. Palaeoecological records, which provide quantitative proxy records of ecosystems prior to human impact, are essential for understanding recent extinctions and future extinction risks. Here we critically review the value of the most recent fossil record in contributing to our understanding of modern extinctions and illustrate through case studies how naturally occurring death assemblages and Holocene sedimentary records provide context to the plight of marine ecosystems. While palaeoecological data are inherently restricted censuses of past communities (manipulative experiments are not possible), they yield quantitative records over temporal scales that are beyond the reach of ecology. Only by including palaeoecological data is it possible to fully assess the role of long-term anthropogenic processes in driving modern extinction risk.},

  abstract = {The dating of depths in two or more cores is frequently followed by a study of the synchroneity or otherwise of events reflected in the cores. The difficulties most frequently encountered are: (a) determining precisely the depths associated with the events; and (b) determining the ages associated with the depths. There has been much progress in recent years in developing tools for the study of uncertainties in establishing chronologies. This has not yet been matched by similar progress in modelling event/depth relationships. This paper proposes a simple and flexible approach, showing how uncertain events can be married to uncertain chronologies. Difficulties in studying event/depth/age relationships typically involve a confounding of two different problems. First, what exactly do we mean by an `event' \textendash{} a point in history, a single depth in the core corresponding to a single time, or a depth/time range? Sometimes `event' is in fact a shorthand for a space-time process. Do the data reflect more than one type of event/process? This can reflect vagueness in definition. Second, what are the sources and implications of the uncertainties? Here we illustrate the issues involved by examination of several features seen in north European Holocene pollen records. The Alnus rise is regarded as a diachronous early Holocene event; in contrast the Ulmus decline is widely seen as a near synchronous event in the mid-Holocene. The third feature we examine is the interval between the Ulmus decline and the first occurrence of Cerealia-type pollen. The evidence for these events lies in cores of lake sediment from which are determined: (a) the proportions of pollen at many depths; and (b) radiocarbon age estimates from, usually, fewer depths. For this illustration we focus on six sites. We draw attention to a new and flexible method (implemented in the free R software package Bchron; [Haslett, J., Parnell, A., 2008. A simple monotone process with application to radiocarbon dated depth chronologies. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C 57 (4), 399\textendash{} 418]) for the establishment of the uncertainties surrounding the dating of samples in such cores. We illustrate its flexibility by assessing the synchroneity of past events.},

  abstract = {The amount of palaeoecological information available continues to grow rapidly, providing improved descriptions of the dynamics of past ecosystems and enabling them to be seen from new perspectives. At the same time, there has been concern over whether palaeoecological enquiry needs to move beyond descriptive inference to a more hypothesis-focussed or experimental approach; however, the extent to which conventional hypothesis-driven scientific frameworks can be applied to historical contexts (i.e., the past) is the subject of ongoing debate. In other disciplines concerned with human-environment interactions, including physical geography and archaeology, there has been growing use of generative simulation models, typified by agent-based approaches. Generative modelling encourages counter-factual questioning (``what if\textbackslash ldots?''), a mode of argument that is particularly important in systems and time-periods, such as the Holocene and now the Anthropocene, where the effects of humans and other biophysical processes are deeply intertwined. However, palaeoecologically focused simulation of the dynamics of the ecosystems of the past either seems to be conducted to assess the applicability of some model to the future or treats humans simplistically as external forcing factors. In this review we consider how generative simulation-modelling approaches could contribute to our understanding of past human-environment interactions. We consider two key issues: the need for null models for understanding past dynamics and the need to be able learn more from pattern-based analysis. In this light, we argue that there is considerable scope for palaeocology to benefit from developments in generative models and their evaluation. We discuss the view that simulation is a form of experiment and, by using case studies, consider how the many patterns available to palaeoecologists can support model evaluation in a way that moves beyond simplistic pattern-matching and how such models might also inform us about the data themselves and the processes generating them. Our emphasis is on how generative simulation might complement traditional palaeoecological methods and proxies rather than on a detailed overview of the modelling methods themselves.},
