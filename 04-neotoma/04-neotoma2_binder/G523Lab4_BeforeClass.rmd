### Things to Do Before Class

#### Install Packages: Install *neotoma2* and associated packages using:
devtools::install_github('NeotomaDB/neotoma2')
library(neotoma2)

#### Read:
Goring, S., Dawson, A., Simpson, G., Ram, K., Graham, R. W., Grimm, E. C., and Williams, J. W. (2015) neotoma: A Programmatic Interface to the Neotoma Paleoecological Database. Open Quaternary 1:1-17.

Note that the *neotoma* package described here has been superceded by the *neotoma2* package released in February, 2022, but this 2015 paper provides a good general overview.  Many of the functions remain similar in concept between *neotoma* and *neotoma2*; the big change is in the structure of the data objects returned by the functions.  The *neotoma2* data objects tend to be more complex but also more comprehensive.
