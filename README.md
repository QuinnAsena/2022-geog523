A binder instance can be found [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WilliamsPaleoLab/2022-geog523/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio). This will launch R studio in your browser with all the necessary packages pre-installed. Note that work done in binder is not saved after you close the binder, which automatically expires after a few hours of inactivity. You can download your work onto your local machine.
